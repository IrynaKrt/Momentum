## Somethings about me:
#### My name is Irina, I'm 19 years old and my English is not that good...
#### By education I am a teacher of German, with level B2, but I became interested in another "language". And now for a little over 5 months I have been learning JavaScript! 
#### Of my strengths, I can single out perseverance and diligence - which allows me not to quit my studies, even when it is very difficult! I am also an open, active and very sociable person.
#### I am ready to learn and learn new things, because I want to be useful!

## About this project:
#### This is my second educational project at RSschool based on the original application - Google-Momentum. There is not much functionality, but it will be updated in the future!
#### I thank in advance those who will express their objective opinion and tell me what can be improved â™¡
